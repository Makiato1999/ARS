# Canadian Airline Reservation System
The Airline Reservation System (ARS) is an android application (called Flight) that makes the flight booking process for airline travellers as easy and efficient as possible as it contains fare comparison capabilties, multiple airline schedules and other time and money saving features.
# Introduction
This was a group project for my winter 2022 term and the project was done in group of 5 members. We used the 3-tier architecture by splitting the work into presentation layer, logic layer and persistence layer.
